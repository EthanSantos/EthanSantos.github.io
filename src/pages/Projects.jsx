I coded the game in <strong>Lua</strong>, handling all aspects of production, including 3D modeling and UI design. Key features included sophisticated bots with human-like movement patterns, a global leaderboard system, and a multiplayer mode that boosted engagement by <strong>40%</strong>. I also created in-game products that contributed significantly to revenue and actively marketed the game through trailers and ads. This multi-year project honed my programming skills and deepened my understanding of game development, marketing, and user engagement."}
